# preemptive
 Write a program to implement priority scheduling algorithm with context switching
time. Prompt to user to enter the number of processes and then enter their priority, burst
time and arrival time also. Now whenever operating system preempts a process and
shifts cpuâ€™s control to some another process of higher priority assume that it takes 2
seconds for context switching(dispatcher latency).
Calculate waiting time and turnaround time for each process
